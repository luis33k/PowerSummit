I want you to generate a full Excel-style master training log with all columns, formatting, and formulas included. DO NOT simplify it. that is the master_log but with this!
This log must track:

I. Daily Inputs

Date

Phase / Training Block (Deload, Build, Sustain, Peak)

Sport (Cycling / Running / Both)

Location (Indoor / Outdoor)

Sleep (hrs)

Wake Time

Weight (lbs)

RHR

Mood (1–10)

Energy (1–10)

Hunger (1–10)

Dopamine cravings (1–10)

Notes (text)

II. Cycling Inputs

Cycling Duration (hrs)

Cycling Distance (mi)

Cycling Speed (mph)

Cycling Elevation (ft)

Avg Watt (Estimated or Power Meter)

Bike Type (Gravel / Road / Indoor Trainer)

Position (Drops / Hoods / Tops / Mix)

Wind (mph)

Temperature (°F)

Humidity (%)

Session Type (Z1, Z2, Tempo, Threshold, VO2, Race Simulation) 

Time in Heart Rate Zones (min) (Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4, Zone 5)

III. Running Inputs

Run Duration (hrs)

Run Distance (mi)

Run Pace (min/mi)

Run RPE

Run Session Type

Run Elevation (ft)

HR (Avg + Max)

Time in Heart Rate Zones (min) (Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4, Zone 5)

IV. Nutrition

Total Calories

Protein (g)

Carbs (g)

Fat (g)

Sugar (g)

Sodium (mg)

Potassium (mg)

Sodium Intra (mg)

Intra Fuel Carbs per Hour (g/hr)

V. Calculated Metrics
Cycling Calculations

Cycling KJ = Duration * Avg Watt * 3600 / 1000

Cycling Calories Burned = KJ * 0.95

Cycling Intensity Factor = Avg Watt / FTP_Used

Cycling TSS = (Duration hrs × IF² × 100)

Running Calculations

Running KJ = (Run Calories Burned * 4.184)

Run TSS = (Run Duration (min) × Run RPE²) / 10

Run Calories Burned = MET-based (use 9–12 MET typical depending on pace)

Totals

Total Training Hours

Total Mileage (Bike + Run)

Total KJ (Bike + Run)

Total TSS (Bike + Run)

Surplus/Deficit = Calories In – Calories Burned

Recovery Score = (Sleep × 0.4) + (Mood × 0.3) + (RHR variability × 0.3)

VI. Rolling Metrics (Automatic Formulas)

Avg Watt (7-day rolling avg)

KJ (7-day rolling avg)

TSS (7-day avg)

Sleep (7-day avg)

Carb Intake/hr (7-day avg)

Surplus/Deficit (7-day avg)

VII. Fitness/Fatigue Formulas

Use these:

ATL = 7-day EWMA of TSS

CTL = 42-day EWMA of TSS

TSB = CTL – ATL

YOUR JOB:

Create an Excel CSV with all columns listed.

Insert formulas where needed.

Make sure the sheet supports unlimited daily entries.

DO NOT simplify the table — use full column names exactly as written.

Output the entire CSV structure with formulas included.
